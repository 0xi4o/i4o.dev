In medieval Europe before the Industrial Revolution, guilds were a common existence. Guilds oversaw the practice and improvement of a craft and masters of the craft were called craftsman. One of the responsibilities of craftsman is to progress the craft and teach it to their apprentices, practitioners who are new to the craft. This was not practiced just in Europe but around the world. But guilds disappeared over time but the idea of craftsman stayed.

When I say craftsman we immediately think about a lone blacksmith or a carpenter, toiling away in a workshop. But whatever they produce, we consider it valuable because there's attention to detail in their work. They have a tendency to do things right, a very strict way to do those things which they don't deviate from. But we usually consider them stuck in their old ways.

*## *Can software be considered a craft?

Certainly. As software engineers, we create something from basically nothing and it could end up being used by a few people or billions of people. If software is a craft then we can definitely become a craftsperson. But we don't have the support structure of a guild or a master who can oversee our work when we're learning.

Guilds don't exist anymore, certainly not for software. There are similar versions for other professions though. To become a doctor, you have to get certified after several years of study and practice. To become a lawyer, you have to pass the bar exam. Without the overseeing authority, you can't practice the craft, at least not legally. Software Engineers don't have that. A degree in Computer Science is not a requisite to practice software engineering. There are hundreds of thousands of self-taught developers. We have a democracy that some other professions don't enjoy. But that doesn't mean that we can't perform to a level of standard.
