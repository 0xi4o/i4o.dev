Exactly a year ago, I wrote about setting up a terminal you will love to use. On Hashnode, it's my most popular [article](https://ilango.hashnode.dev/setting-up-a-terminal-you-will-love-to-use), getting over 13k views. Clearly, it's a topic of interest for many. Almost all tools, frameworks, and languages require some process running in the background, which is started from a terminal. Our IDEs and code editors come with terminal(s) built-in. Suffice it to say, terminals have become an important part of our workflow.

But over the months following that article, I started exploring other tools to improve my productivity, and out of curiosity. I've made some improvements, started using alternatives, and written some custom scripts.

## Things that changed

### Hello Kitty

While Tabby was a good terminal, it wasn't fast enough. Plus, it was an electron app, which I'm not a fan of. I needed something faster. I've already heard of and used Alacritty, but I wanted to try something else this time. One of the commenters in that article, suggested I try [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). And so I did. It's now my terminal emulator of choice.

While kitty comes with a lot of great features including tabs, a built-in multiplexer, etc, I don't use any of them. I haven't even changed any of the configurations available. I only have a single terminal window open, and this is the starting point of something really cool I've set up. But before that, a note on the shell and related tools.

### Zsh/Oh My Zsh/Starship

My shell of choice is still zsh. I still use Oh My Zsh and Starship on top of it. I do have some updates for my `.zshrc` file. I've added a bunch of nice aliases for commands that I use often. Â For example, I have a few aliases for traversing directories:

    # cd aliases
    alias ..='cd ..'
    alias ...='cd ../..'
    alias .3='cd ../../..'
    alias .4='cd ../../../..'
    alias .5='cd ../../../../..'

These aliases save me so much effort. Another one is for grep:

    alias grep='grep --color=auto'

And since I'm using Remix a lot, and have a custom stack set up:

    # new project aliases
    alias remix-new='pnpm create remix@latest --template i4o-oss/synthwave-stack'

I suggest you set up aliases for commands that you often use. But don't go overboard. The problem with aliases is that you get used to them pretty quickly. So when you have to use a terminal that doesn't have your aliases (like when ssh-ing into a server), you'll miss them and probably would have forgotten the actual command.

### Tmux

Alright, let's get to the good stuff. Like I said before, Kitty has a terminal multiplexer built in but I don't use that. Instead, I use Tmux. That's because tmux has been around for a long time, it does one thing and it does it really well. The real power of tmux is unlocked when we automate what we typically do inside tmux.

Stuff like, creating sessions, windows, and panes, changing directories, running dev servers, etc. Tmux also lets us execute commands when we create new windows and panes.

The starting point of my tmux workflow is a keybind I set up in my `zshrc`. When I press `Ctrl + f`, zsh runs a script called `tmux-sessionizer`.

This script does two things:

It first lists all the directories that I open and work in, on a regular basis. This includes code repositories for side projects, work, open-source projects I'm interested in exploring, learning repos, etc. From this list, I can type and search for the particular directory I want to go into, using a command-line fuzzy finder called [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

When I find the directory, I press enter. The script then checks if tmux is running, then checks if a tmux session with the name of the directory already exists. If it does, it switches to that session. If not, it creates a session with the chosen directory name.

For specific directories, like web projects, I usually create 3 windows within a tmux session: one for [lunarvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/), one for running commands in the git repo, one for running a dev server. The script automatically handles all of this and puts me straight into lunarvim, so I can start coding right away and have a dev server running.

Here's how it looks in practice:

// TODO: Insert a video recording here.

This one scripts removes so many manual steps that I do everyday, just to start coding. I've also added a keybind in my `.tmux.conf` that runs this script. So when I have to switch to another project (or another branch within the same project because I use git worktrees), it takes me only a couple of seconds to have everything up and running.
