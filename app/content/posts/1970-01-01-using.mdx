I can't remember the last time I set up a database or managed one manually. That's because hosted solutions are a much better choice today for a few reasons.

1. They drastically reduce the time it takes to get started.
2. There's basically no maintenance that you have to do. 
3. They play well with serverless environments.

As I've written before, my hosted database solution of choice is Planetscale.
