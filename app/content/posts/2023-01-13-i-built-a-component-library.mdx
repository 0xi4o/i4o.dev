In the past few months, I've prototyped several toy projects to explore ideas, learn new things, etc. Having a well-thought-out project starter is one of the crucial parts of being able to quickly build something and test out an idea. While I have a [pretty solid project starter](https://github.com/i4o-oss/synthwave-stack), one thing that always slowed me down is a collection of React components that I can use in my prototypes.

### Why build a component library in 2023, when there are plenty of choices?

I've tried a few component libraries over the years but I found it hard to settle on one. Last year, I found out about [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) primitives. I instantly liked it. They are unstyled, have built-in accessibility and keyboard navigation, and have a nice API. And they can be styled with whatever technology we want. I'm a huge fan of Tailwind, so naturally, I chose that. Pretty soon, I had a collection of styled components that I could use for my prototypes, and I included them in my starter.

But I ran into a problem. Changing these components meant that the components began to diverge across my projects and copy-pasting got tired very fast. So I decided to bite the bullet and build a component library. [CatalystUI](https://catalyst.i4o.dev) is the result of this work.

Another, and probably the most exciting reason I wanted to build a component library is to learn how to build a good one. Because component libraries and by extension design systems are hard. Providing a good abstraction on top of the existing unstyled components is hard. And what better way to learn than by doing it?

### What's on the roadmap?

In its current state, Catalyst doesn't have all the Radix primitives. There are a basic set of components with an API that I think works for me. Using them will reveal any potential problems. The same goes for the built-in styles and extending those styles in my projects. So first on my list is making the API and styles consistent across the components. 

Radix has a good set of primitives. They're atomic â€” they do one thing and do that well. Catalyst has to first cover all of the available primitives. In addition to that, I want to build more complex components that can be just dropped into an app and will work. Components like navbar, pagination, etc save a ton of time but are not provided by Radix.
