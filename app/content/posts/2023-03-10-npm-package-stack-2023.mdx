I started off this year building two projects that are meant to be deployed as NPM packages. One is [Catalyst UI](https://catalyst-ui.com/) and [Rescribe](https://rescribe.site/). I built and deployed an NPM package years ago at work. At that time, not knowing better, I didn't automate anything. Every time I made a change to the package, I manually ran the build script, tested it on an example repo by manually updating the package, logged into npm from the terminal, and ran npm publish.

This time around, I wanted to do it differently â€” modern tooling, automation, etc. This is the stack I ended up with, by checking what popular libaries are using and what interested me.

## Monorepo with TurboRepo

If you're building any sort of shared libraries or npm packages, using a monorepo is the easiest way to do it. I used to be scared of monorepos. I tried to learn Lerna a few times but it seemed so daunting. 

Turborepo changed that and made it easy to manage monorepos. It's a build system for JS/TS codebases that takes care of running tasks like linting, testing, and building. And it does that super fast by leveraging caching, both locally and remotely. Running a build task but nothing changed from the last build? Turborepo won't do the build again. It would just return the cached version.

You can configure Turborepo using a turbo.json file located in the project root. I rarely touch this file though. If you're using the create-turbo command, it generates a starter that has a turbo.json pre-configured and ready to go.

In a monorepo setup you will have your website or app, shared libraries, and even shared configurations all in one repo. 

For example, I put all my shared libs and configurations in a packages folder in the project root. I then create a different directory for the website(s) or app(s). Now you just have to declare your workspaces in your root package.json file.

```json
{
    "workspaces": [
        "apps/*",
        "packages/*"
    ]
}
```

Now that we have the build system sorted out, let's manage our dependencies. Here's where pnpm workspaces comes in.

## Pnpm Workspaces

I recently moved from yarn to pnpm for Node package management. I made the switch because of the mess that is yarn versions (I still stayed on 1.22) but it worked out quite well because I found pnpm workspaces to be quite easy to use.

You just have to create a pnpm-workspace.yaml file and define your packages.

```yaml
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

In a monorepo, you'll have multiple projects under one roof. Each of those will have its own dependencies and most probably, will depend on one another. Pnpm makes it easy to target specific workspaces from the project root.

We do that using the --filter flag. For example, let's say we want to install a dependency to a workspace called ui under packages. You just have to do this:

pnpm add react react-dom --filter ui

This will install react and react-dom to only the workspace you defined. No need to traverse directories everytime.
