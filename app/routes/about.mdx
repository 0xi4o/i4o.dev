# About Me 

{
    <div className='max-w-2xl'>
        <p>I'm Ilango. I'm a Full Stack Engineer from Bangalore, India.</p>
        <p>Over the past 7 years, I've been building modern web applications for SaaS startups. My main programming language is JavaScript/TypeScript but I've been learning Rust as well. I've also dabbled in Go, Lua, and Python. I write articles regularly here and on <a className='font-semibold text-brand-500' href='https://ilango.hashnode.dev/' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Hashnode</a>, about the things I'm learning and the projects I'm working on.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working as a Senior Full Stack Engineer at Creable. In my free time, I work on <Link className='font-semibold text-brand-500' to='/projects'>side projects</Link>.</p>
        <p>When not working on side projects, I read and occasionally play video games. Check out what I'm reading and playing right <Link className='font-semibold text-brand-500' to='/now'>now</Link>. You can also check out the <Link className='font-semibold text-brand-500' to='/uses'>tools and devices</Link> I use to get my work done.</p>
        <p>Since you're here, I'd appreciate it if you checked out some of my articles. And if you happen to like what you read, I'd appreciate it even more if you subscribed to my website. It's totally free, and you'll be the first to know when I publish new stuff here.</p>
        <p>Cheers!</p>
