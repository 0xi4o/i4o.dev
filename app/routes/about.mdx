# About Me

I'm Ilango. I'm a Full Stack Engineer from Bangalore, India.

I'm currently working as a Senior Full Stack Engineer at Creable.

---

In my free time, I work on <Link to='/projects'>side projects</Link>.

My main programming language is JavaScript/TypeScript but I've been learning Rust as well. I've also dabbled in Go, Lua, and Python. I write articles regularly here and on <Anchor href='https://ilango.hashnode.dev/'>Hashnode</Anchor>, about the things I'm learning and the projects I'm working on.

When not working on side projects, I read and occasionally play video games. Check out what I'm reading and playing right <Link to='/now'>now</Link>. You can also check out the <Link to='/uses'>tools and devices</Link> I use to get my work done.

Since you're here, I'd appreciate it if you checked out some of my <Link to='/blog'>articles</Link>. And if you happen to like what you read, let me know :)

I'm most active on these two platforms. If you're interested in what I'm doing or what I'm saying, do give me a follow here:
